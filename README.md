# ds-prep-workspace

This is my personal workspace to use during the 12 weeks Pre Course of the Lisbon Data Science Academy https://www.lisbondatascience.org

"The Prep Course was designed as a preparation for the Starters Academy. It is fully taught online and lasts for 12 weeks.
You'll learn how to program in Python, how to use the command line, some linear algebra basics and version control with git."

### Update ###
It ended in June 2023 and at that moment I made this repo Public
